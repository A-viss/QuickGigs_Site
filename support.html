                <h2>FAQs</h2>
                <h4>1. When will I receive my payment after completing a project?</h4>
                <p>
                    Once your client marks the project as completed or confirms delivery, your payment will be released
                    to your account. This typically takes 2 to 5 business days, depending on the payment method
                    selected. You can track the status under your <strong>Earnings</strong> section. Delays may occur on
                    weekends or due to verification checks for new users.
                </p>

                <h4>2. What should I do if a client doesn’t respond after I submit the work?</h4>
                <p>
                    If the client does not respond within 72 hours of your submission, the platform will automatically
                    mark the project as completed, and your payment will be processed. However, if the delay exceeds
                    this period or you notice any unusual activity, please contact our support team through <strong>Live
                        Chat</strong> or the <strong>Help Request Form</strong> for assistance.
                </p>

                <h4>3. Can I cancel a project after I’ve started working on it?</h4>
                <p>
                    Cancellations are possible but must be handled carefully. If both you and the client agree to
                    cancel, you can do so through the <strong>project dashboard</strong>. If there is a dispute or
                    disagreement, you can escalate the issue to our support team. We will review communication and
                    delivery history to make a fair decision. Repeated cancellations may affect your freelancer score.
                </p>

                <h4>4. Are there any fees for withdrawing money from my account?</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes, Quick Gigs charges a small withdrawal processing fee, which varies depending on the withdrawal
                    method. For example, PayPal may include both our platform fee and PayPal's own transfer fee. The
                    full fee breakdown is shown when you initiate a withdrawal. We recommend reviewing our
                    <strong>Payment & Fees</strong> page for up-to-date details before selecting your method.
                </p>

                <h4>5. What happens if I miss a project deadline?</h4>
                <p>
                    Missing a deadline can affect your reputation and client trust. If you foresee a delay, it's
                    important to communicate early with your client and request a delivery extension through the
                    platform. If you miss a deadline without any communication, the client has the right to cancel the
                    order or leave negative feedback. Multiple missed deadlines may lower your visibility in search
                    results and reduce your job opportunities.
